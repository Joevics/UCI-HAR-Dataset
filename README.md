<h1>Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project</h1>
This repository is a submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It has the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

<h3>Dataset</h3>
<a href=[http://www.example.com](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)>Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones</a>

<h3>Files</h3>
- <i>CodeBook.md</i> a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

- <i>run_analysis.R</i> performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
     - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
     - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
     - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
     - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
     - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- <i>FinalData.txt</i> is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
